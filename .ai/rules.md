# Global AI Rules

## Language Enforcement

- All documentation content must be written in German (de-DE)
- AI must not introduce English sentences or headings
- UI labels may remain in English if they reflect the product UI
- Mixed-language paragraphs are forbidden

## Allowed actions
- Create or edit Markdown documentation
- Improve clarity without changing meaning
- Add examples consistent with existing behavior

## Forbidden actions
- Inventing features or behavior
- Changing compliance meaning
- Adding legal or certification claims
- Modifying `_meta/` files
- Modifying `sidebars.ts` unless explicitly requested

## General principles
- Prefer modification over creation
- Ask before deleting content
- Keep changes minimal and reversible
- Preserve existing terminology exactly

If unsure, stop and ask.
