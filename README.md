### How to edit documents in VS Code

Follow these steps to edit the documents:

2. From the left sidebar, click on **Source Control** then click **Clone Repository**.
3. Paste the repository URL of **qmBase/docs** GitHub repository (<https://github.com/qmBase/docs.git>) and click **Clone from URL**.
4. Select a path (any folder) where the files will be cloned to.
5. After the cloning process is finished, a pop-up message will show up, click **Open** to open the cloned repository in Visual Studio Code.
6. Now create a new branch by clicking **main** in the bottom left, and choose **Create new branch** and name it then press enter. (use your initials at the beginning, for example: [ab]/BranchName)
7. Do your edits and changes and save them.
8. Click on **Source Control** from the left sidebar.
9. Enter a message about the changes you made and press **Commit**, then **Publish Branch**.
10. Now in GitHub, make a **Pull Request**, then merge your branch with the main branch.

## Development in the cloud

If you do not have installed VS Code on you local machine you can also Open the repository in in the browser. This make writing new documents easier than working on the raw files on Github
Go to [https://vscode.dev/github/qmBase/docs](https://vscode.dev/github/qmBase/docs) and follow the instructions.

## Build

```console
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## Deployment

This project will be deployed to an azure static web app via the azure-pipelines.yml file

## Spell Check

```console
npm run lint:spelling
```

This command runs a spell check using CSpell. If you want any specific words to be ignored by the spell checker, add them to the words list in the `project-words.txt` file.

## Known Issues

Known Issues should be documented in the dedicated folder `./docs/knownIssues/` if the source is a ticket use the `{id}.md` as file name. If the source is a internal ticket use the `{id}_intern.md` as file name.

Add the tag `docs:KnownIssue` to the ticket so that we have a reference there. If multiple tickets reference a knownIssue entry put the link to the knownIssue as a comment to the ticket.

### Key Docusaurus concepts (important for structure)

`docs/` = source of truth

- Every folder → sidebar category
- `index.md` → category landing page
- Frontmatter controls navigation, ordering, labels

### AI-friendly conventions for docs/

1️⃣ Keep _meta/ separate

This prevents accidental publishing.

```
docs/_meta/
  vision.md        # Why this site exists
  audience.md      # Personas
  non-goals.md
```

2️⃣ One page = one responsibility

Avoid giant Markdown files.

✅ installation.md
❌ everything.md

3️⃣ Stable paths

Renaming files breaks links and agent memory.

### 5. src/ – when (and when not) to touch it

Agents should:

- ❌ Avoid touching `src/theme/` unless necessary
- ✅ Add components only when Markdown is insufficient

Typical cases:

- Interactive diagrams
- Custom callouts
- Auth-aware content

### Static assets best practice

```
static/img/docs/
static/img/blog/
```

### AI-specific .ai/ folder (optional but powerful)

```
.ai/
├── rules.md         # Global constraints
├── memory.md        # Decisions & context
├── changelog.md     # What the AI changed
└── prompts/
```

Example `rules.md`:

```
- Do not change published docs without explicit instruction
- Prefer modifying existing files
- Ask before creating new categories
```

## How to instruct the agent

System prompt:

```
You are an AI documentation agent for a Quality Management SaaS.

Before acting, you must:
1. Read and follow all files in `.ai/`
2. Treat `.ai/constraints.md` as absolute
3. Treat `.ai/rules.md` as behavioral law
4. Treat `docs/_meta/*` as canonical domain truth
5. Preserve terminology defined in `_meta/terminology.md`

You may:
- Edit documentation Markdown files
- Improve clarity without changing meaning

You must never:
- Modify `.ai/` files
- Modify `docs/_meta/`
- Invent features or compliance claims
- Change the meaning of existing content

All changes must be logged in `.ai/changelog.md`.

If a request violates any rule, stop and explain why.
```

Second prompt:
How tasks should be given to the agent

### ❌ Bad task

“Improve the docs for qualifications”

### ✅ Good task

“Clarify how qualification validity resets work in docs/guides/qualifications/validity.md.
Do not change compliance meaning.
Preserve terminology.
Log changes.”

The more constrained, the better.
