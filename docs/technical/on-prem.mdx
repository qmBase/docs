qmBase can also be installed on your own hardware. While this is technically possible, it is not the preferred way of our customers to use qmBase. At the time of writing more than **93%** of our customers are using our default cloud based version.

## Feature Comparison

While we try to achieve feature parity of our cloud version and the software you can install in your own data center there are some differences.
The differences are shown in the table below.

| Feature                        | Cloud         | On-Premises                            |
| ------------------------------ | ------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Backup                         | Managed by us | Managed by you                         |
| Automatic weekly notifications | Managed by us | Requires at least one login per 7 days |

## Installation

In the following section the installation for various options is described.

### Install on Windows

:::

#### How to install?

1. Download the latest qmBase version from [here](https://app.qmbase.com/downloads/). You will get the credentials via mail after you have signed the contract.
2. Extract the ZIP file to the folder where the IIS is located.
3. Run the latest database migrations. The SQL scripts will be provided on the download page as well. You will need to create 2 databases. Use the following name schema

   - multi-tenant
   - qmbase[CustomerId]

4. qmBase requires a SSL connection. So you have to configure the IIS to use either a self signed certificate or use a regular certificate. The assigned url must not contain **qmbase**. You can use **qm-base** as an alternative.
5. Configure qmBase and start running.

##### Configure qmBase

To configure qmBase you have take actions in 2 different places.

Insert this row in your multi tenant database

```sql
INSERT INTO [yourDatabase].[dbo].[MultiTenants]
(
  ,[DatabaseType]
  ,[Host]
  ,[ConnectionString]
  ,[StorageConnectionString]
  ,[Name]
  ,[CustomerId]
)
VALUES
(
  ,0
  ,pathToYour.qmbase
  ,SQL Connection string
  ,NULL
  ,yourCustomerName
  ,yourCustomerId
)
```

Change the appSettings.Production.json file

```json
// These settings will only be applied if HostingEnvironment is "Production"
// Use this file to customize the behavior in Production
// Be aware of invalid json due to unescaped characters, trailing comma etc.
{
  //ApplicationInsights settings omitted for brevity.
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "MultiTenantConnection": "Connection string to multiTenantContext",
    // These settings are not needed if multiTenant==true
    "DefaultConnection": "Your Ms SQL ConnectionString -> not needed in MultiTenantScenario"
  },
  "AppSettings": {
    "MultiTenantContext": true,
    "StorageType": "FileSystem", //"FileSystem" | "AzureBlobStorage"
    "PhysicalFileProviderRootPath": "D:\\qmbase\\uploads"
  }
}
```

#### How to update?

We are improving qmBase continuously. That means that we are releasing multiple Updates per Day. So if you are experiencing any bugs you can always try to download the latest release.

1. Delete all files in <code>app</code> folder except **web.config** and **appSettings.Production.json**.
2. Extract the zip file from the update and copy all files except **web.config** and **appSettings.Production.json** to the <code>app</code> folder.
