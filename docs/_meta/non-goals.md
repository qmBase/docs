# Non-Goals

This documentation does NOT:
- Claim ISO 9001 certification or compliance by default
- Replace professional consulting or auditing
- Prescribe a single “correct” quality management system
- Document internal development decisions
- Serve as marketing or sales material

Statements such as:
- “This guarantees ISO compliance”
- “This replaces an audit”
- “This is legally binding”

must never appear.
