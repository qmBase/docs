# Compliance Context

This software supports quality management activities commonly aligned with:
- ISO 9001
- Internal quality policies
- Industry-specific standards

Important clarifications:
- The software **supports** compliance activities
- Compliance depends on correct configuration and usage
- Responsibility remains with the organization

Documentation must:
- Avoid normative language (“must comply with ISO…”)
- Clearly separate software functionality from organizational responsibility
