# Documentation Principles

1. Task-oriented first
   - Explain what the user wants to achieve
   - Then explain how to do it

2. Explicit over implicit
   - Never assume default behavior is obvious
   - Always state system effects

3. Audit-safe language
   - Avoid absolute claims
   - Use “can”, “may”, “supports” instead of “ensures”

4. One concept per page
   - Avoid multi-purpose documents

5. Traceability
   - Explain why a feature exists when relevant
   - Reference related concepts explicitly

6. Stable terminology
   - The same concept must always use the same term
